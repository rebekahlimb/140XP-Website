## Hi there!


My name is Rebekah Limb and I am a 22 year old aspiring researcher in the intersection of statistics and cognitive modeling. I am a Regent Scholar senior at UCLA graduating with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science and a B.S. in Cognitive Science. I have worked in the Visual Intelligence Lab at UCLA led by Professor Tao Gao. 

At UCLA, I have had the amazing opportunity to join and help lead organizations such as DataRes, the university's largest data science organization. I also have been able to explore my creative side with graphic design as part Daily Bruin's Data & Graphics team. 

Outside of academics I love playing volleyball, taking strolls at the beach, or going to see my favorite artists in concert.
